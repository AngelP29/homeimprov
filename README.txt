Home Improvement & Repair Scheduler
Allows the user to input a brief description of the home improvement project or issue like repairing a drywall hole.
The app uses AI to classify the severity of the issue or the complexity of the project and estimates a deadline for the user to follow along with a list of materials required to fulfil the task. This deadline is placed into a calendar.
The app also provides links to tutorials and resources to accomplish the task.
The user can interact with the calendar by:
 -Deleting events created by AI. 
 -Manually add a task to the calendar
 -Mark a task as complete, in progress, or postpone.
No log in required.
